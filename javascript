It is a scripting language which makes our webpages more interactive
e.g, we need to add a calculator i our site
we use <script>tag inside body tag:
As there is too much scripting languages so in order to specify javascript:
<script type = "text/javascript">
</script>

To check whether our browser supports javascript or not write inside script tag
document.write("checking:");

For safety against older browser:
<!--
document.write("checking:");
//-->

Comments in javascript use: 1. // single line comment
2./*..........
.........*/
