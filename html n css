                                What is HTML?
HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages.
HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages and are represented by tags<>
<tagname>content goes here...</tagname>

The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag
HTML elements with no content are called empty elements. Empty elements do not have an end tag, such as the <br> element (which indicates a line break).

HTML tags label pieces of content such as "heading", "paragraph", "table", and so on

-->
    The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration defines version of HTML (The <!DOCTYPE> declaration is not case sensitive.)
    The <html> element is the root element of an HTML page
    The <head> element contains meta information about the document (metadata is data about the HTML document. Metadata is not displayed.)
    --all the browser info goes into the head tag
    The <title> element specifies a title for the document.(it is done inside head tag)
    The <body> element contains the visible page content
    The <h1> element defines a large heading
    Note: Browsers automatically add some white space (a margin) before and after a heading.
    The <p> element defines a paragraph

-- the technical stuff(like keywords for search engines,etc) is in head tag and all cool stuff is in the body tag
The purpose of a web browser  is to read HTML documents and display them.

The browser does not display the HTML tags, but uses them to determine how to display the document.

HTML headings are defined with the <h1> to <h6> tags.
<h1> defines the most important heading. <h6> defines the least important heading: 

HTML paragraphs are defined with the <p> tag

HTML links are defined with the <a> (anchor)tag:
<a href="https://www.w3schools.com">This is a link</a> 
The link's destination is specified in the href attribute. (attributes are used to provide additional information about HTML elements)

HTML images are defined with the <img> tag.
The source file (src), alternative text (alt), width, and height are provided as attributes:
 <img src="w3schools.jpg" alt="W3Schools.com" width="104" height="142"> 



    All HTML elements can have attributes
    Attributes are always specified in the start tag
    Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value"
The language of the document can be declared in the <html> tag.
<html lang="en-US">

        a title attribute is added to the <p> element. The value of the title attribute will be displayed as a tooltip when you mouse over the paragraph:
     <p title="I'm a tooltip">
This is a paragraph.
</p> 

The <hr> tag defines a thematic break in an HTML page, and is most often displayed as a horizontal rule.

You cannot be sure how HTML will be displayed.
Large or small screens, and resized windows will create different results.
With HTML,you cannot change the output by adding extra spaces or extra lines in your HTML code.
The browser will remove any extra spaces and extra lines when the page is displayed

The HTML <pre> element defines preformatted text.
The text inside a <pre> element is displayed in a fixed-width font (usually Courier), and it preserves both spaces and line breaks

Setting the style of an HTML element, can be done with the style attribute.
Syntax:  
<tagname style="property:value;">
The property is a CSS property. The value is a CSS value.
 

The background-color property defines the background color for an HTML element (#E6E6FA)
The color property defines the text color for an HTML element
The font-family property defines the font to be used for an HTML element
The font-size property defines the text size for an HTML element
The text-align property defines the horizontal text alignment for an HTML element

HTML also defines special elements for defining text with a special meaning:
    <b> - Bold text
    <strong> - Important text
    <i> - Italic text
    <em> - Emphasized text
    <mark> - Marked/highlighted text
    <small> - Small text
    <del> - Deleted text
    <ins> - Inserted text
    <sub> - Subscript text
    <sup> - Superscript text

    The HTML <q> element defines a short quotation
The HTML <blockquote> element defines a section that is quoted from another source.
<blockquote cite="http://www.worldwildlife.org/who/index.html">

The HTML <abbr> element defines an abbreviation or an acronym.
 <p>The <abbr title="World Health Organization">WHO</abbr> was founded in 1948.</p> 

The HTML <cite> element defines the title of a work.

The HTML <bdo> element defines bi-directional override.
The <bdo> element is used to override the current text direction:
<bdo dir="rtl">This text will be written from right to left</bdo> 

You can add comments to your HTML source by using the following syntax:
<!-- Write your comments here --> 

NAVIGATION SYSTEM(i.e. link to move within same page):
  to do this first set a destination path as:
  <a name="section"></a>(we don't need any link ass it is our destination)
  and then inside body tag give its reference as:
  <a href="#desired section"
  this will take us to our desired section>

   link to email address:
  <a href="mailto:deep745d@gmail.com">Email Deep</a>

In HTML, a color can be specified by using a color name, an RGB value, or a HEX value:
 1.  In HTML, a color can be specified by using a color name:Red,Orange,Yellow,Cyan ,Blue.
 
 2.  In HTML, a color can also be specified as an RGB value, using this formula: rgb(red, green, blue)
 For example, rgb(255,0,0) is displayed as red, because red is set to its highest value (255) and the others are set to 0.

To display the color black, all color parameters must be set to 0, like this: rgb(0,0,0).

To display the color white, all color parameters must be set to 255, like this: rgb(255,255,255). 

3. In HTML, a color can also be specified using a hexadecimal value in the form: #RRGGBB, where RR (red), GG (green) and BB (blue) are hexadecimal values between 00 and FF (same as decimal 0-255).

                        ,,,, Styling HTML with CSS,,,,

HTML is the core foundation and CSS is used for designing

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.

CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media.

CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.

CSS can be added to HTML elements in 3 ways:

    Inline - by using the style attribute in HTML elements
    Internal - by using a <style> element in the <head> section
    External - by using an external CSS file

         An inline CSS is used to apply a unique style to a single HTML element.
An inline CSS uses the style attribute of an HTML element.
 <h1 style="color:blue;">This is a Blue Heading</h1> 

         An internal CSS is used to define a style for a single HTML page.
An internal CSS is defined in the <head> section of an HTML page, within a <style> element:
<head>
<style type="text/css">
elementname {property:value;
	property2:its value}	
</style>
</head>

<head>
<style>
body {background-color: powderblue;}
h1   {color: blue;}
p {line-height: 150%;}                     (used for line spacing)

</style>
</head>

          An external style sheet is used to define the style for many HTML pages.
With an external style sheet, you can change the look of an entire web site, by changing one file!
To use an external style sheet, add a link to it in the <head> section of the HTML page:
<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
   An external style sheet can be written in any text editor. The file must not contain any HTML code, and must be saved with a .css extension.

 The CSS border property defines a border around an HTML element:
 p {
    border: 1px solid powderblue;
}

  The CSS padding property defines a padding (space) between the text and the border:
  p {
    border: 1px solid powderblue;
    padding: 30px;
}
   The CSS margin property defines a margin (space) outside the border:
    p {
    border: 1px solid powderblue;
    margin: 50px;
}
 

 also, In order to deal with multiple div we use id's:

  To define a specific style for one special element, add an id attribute to the element:
<p id="p01">I am different</p>
then define a style for the element with the specific id in head tag:
#p01 {
    color: blue;
} 
Note: The id of an element should be unique within a page, so the id selector is used to select one unique element!

******
      To define a style for a special type of elements, add a class attribute to the element:
<p class="classname">I am different</p>           (therefore a way to customise same element)
<p class="secclass">ok</p>
then define a style for the elements with the specific class:
p.classname {
    color: red;
} 
p.secclass {
	color: green;
}

     External style sheets can be referenced with a full URL or with a path relative to the current web page.
    1.This example uses a full URL to link to a style sheet:
     <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/styles.css"> 
    2.This example links to a style sheet located in the html folder on the current web site:
      <link rel="stylesheet" href="/html/styles.css"> 
    3. This example links to a style sheet located in the same folder as the current page:
       <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css"> 

MAKING TABLE: tables have rows(tr) and columns(td) {use border="1"with table tag}
<table>
 <tr>                       (This e.g. makes two rows as two tr and 2 columns each as two td)
<td>Deep</td>
<td>Karan</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
 <td>Akhil</td>
<td>Datt</td>
 </tr>
</table>
to make it more good use attribute border .

<style type="text/css">
	table{border: 3px solid blue;}
	tr {background-color: yellow;}
	td {border:2px dashed;}
</style>

** Wheneever we apply something to table it effects tr as well as td , whenever we apply something to tr it effects tr and td but whenever we apply something to td it doesn't effect anything except td



MAKING HEADER FOR TABLES:
use <th></th>tag within <tr></tr>to make headings for your data.

if we wanna expand our particular column then we can use colspan attribute inside our <table>

table width: 1.this can be done width attribute along with border and we can give its value either by pixels or by %

2.CELLPADDING: it provides space b/w text and border (use cellpadding attribute)
3. CELLSPACING: it provides space b/w cells itself  (use cellspacing attribute)

LIST: 
1. Unordered list : <ul></ul>
and to enter items in list use<li></li> insise ul tag
2. Ordered list: <ol></ol>(only difference is that now items come numbered)

Styling unordered list:
<style type="text/css">
	ul {list-style-type: circle;}                    (changing bullets)
</style>
--> we can also customise our bullet points by downloading it:
  but use ul{list-style-image:url(filename);}

->ul{border:1 px solid red;
       list-style-type:none;           (removes bullet)
          padding:0;}                   (removes default padding)

Formal way to bold, italicised text and text-align:
<style type="text/css">
	p {font-weight: bold;font-style: italic; }
    h1 {text-align: center;}

     p{text-indent: 25px;}                (used for indentation)

</style>

when we wanna effect whole website then we have to use body element inside style tag

******************************
How to add images in our background?
<style type="text/css">
	body {background-image: url(nameoffile);}
     background-repeat:no repeat;                 (gives only single image)
      background-repeat: repeat-x;         (repeat along x-axis)
    background-position: 10px 60px         
                        (right)(down)
                        (we can also use percentage)
</style>

CSS BLOCK MODEL:
Padding-> space b/w text and border
Margin -> space outside border and outside padding
Border-> area that outlines padding
** Padding is inside the border while margin is outside the border


<style type="text/css"> 
h1 {padding: 20px;}
                                          (we can use keyword top,left,right,bottom)
</style>

Border has three property :
border-color: red;
border-width:  3px;
border-style:  dashed;

We can also make different borders in different directions:
border-top-color: ;
__________________
________________

we can also use a shorthand technique :
{
border: 3px solid black;}



to adjust margin(space b.w paragraph):
<style type="text/css">
	p {margin: 1px;}

</style>

<style type="text/css">
h4 { width: 350px;
height: 100px; }          (in gen we don't deal with height)
</style>

How to style links?  <a href="https://www.google.com">google</a>
One link has actually four different states:
<style type="text/css">
	a:link{color: red;
	       text-decoration: none;}                     (this sets default link)
	a:visited{color: green;}                            (tells whether link is previsited)
	a:hover{background-color: blue;                      (modifies hover properties)
	           text-decoration: underline;
	            font-weight: bold;}
	a:active{background-color: orange;}                   (holding mouse gives active state)
</style>

How to style more than one element at a time:
 <style type="text/css">
 	h1 , p {color: red;}
 </style>

Whenever we wanna style particular portion of our element then use span:
<style type="text/css">
	span {font-weight: bold;}
</style>
<p>today <span>is the</span> day </p>

*************
THE div ELEMENT:  
->it gives us ability to arrange different section in our webpage 

<style type="text/css">
	div {border: 2px;
	     position: absolute;
	     width: 300px;
	     top: 40px;                     (navigation)
	     left:35px; }
</style>
...
<body>
<div>abc</div>
</body>
